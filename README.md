# Road_Accident_Dashboard_Excel
Hello everybody 
My third project entailed using Microsoft Excel to create an interactive dashboard that analyzed and summarized data for a road accident, which was just recently finished.

📝 TO COMPARE THE ROAD ACCIDENTS THAT OCCURRED IN 2021 AND 2022
🔔 Requirements:
➡ Make a dashboard for road accidents for the years 2021 and 2022.
➡ Show the total number of casualties. 
➡Total fatalities and their percentages according to accident severity, 
➡ Casualties per type of vehicle 
➡Comparison of the monthly trends in casualties for 2021 & 2022 
➡Maximum casualties by type of road 
➡Total casualty distribution by road surface relationship between casualties by area, location, and day/night

♻ Analysis of the Dataset:
✔ Cleaning of Data 
✔Processing of Data 
✔Analysis of Data
✔Dashboard for data visualization

🔰 Outcomes: 
📍 417883 total casualties
📍 Other casualties have the highest accident record rate, 
with the majority of accidents occurring in urban areas.
📍The proportion of car accident casualties that occur during the day as 
compared to at night, when it is at its highest.
📍The majority of accidents occur on single-carriageway roads. 
📍When compared to other types of roads, dry surface roads experience the highest number of accidents
